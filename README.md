# cheat-at-minigolf
A small 2d python game where you place items on a minigolf course that help you get a hole in one

## Description

This program is a 2d puzzle game where the goal is to get a perfect score in minigolf - by cheating. Place various tools that can manipulate the path of the ball throughout the course, then take a swing. You can only win by scoring a hole in one. 

This game is written in python using the pygame library. The main goal of this project is to gain experience in python programming, software design and architecture, and developing a complete program from start to finish using a fun, low-stakes goal.

## Roadmap

* **Phase 1 - Current**
  * Create a toolbox with an item that can be pulled out of it
  * Create an initial golf course that a toolbox item can be placed on
  * implement a grid for the golf course that the toolbox item can snap to
  * Create a screen for starting the game
  
* ** Phase 2**
  * Create a golf swing action that allows the user to choose a power and angle
  * Create a golf ball that moves based on the user's swing
  * Create a hole for the golf course that the golf ball can roll into
  * Create win and lose condition based on whether or not the ball went into the hole
  
* **Phase 3**
  * Create the fan tool, which will constantly blow in a single direction to a set number of squares, where if the ball rolls into the wind path, it will move a certain amount in that direction
  * design the golf course so that the fan tool is required to sink the ball
  
* **Future Phases** 
  * design more levels
  * Create level progression
  * Create game saving and loading
  * Create more tools
  * Implement 'getting caught' mechanic
